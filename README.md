# Simple Bank Exercise

The Simple Bank directory is a truffle project that contains the required contract, migration and test files. In this exercise you are going to implement the SimpleBank.sol contract.

The contract contains the framework and comments to implement the contract. Follow the comments outlined in the SimpleBank.sol contract to implement the contract. We have written a set of tests to determine if you implement the contract correctly. 

To test your implementation start your development blockchain by running truffle develop. From the truffle console, compile and migrate the contracts by running compile and migrate. You can run the pre-written tests by running test.

If your tests do not pass, modify the contract, recompile, redeploy and retest. Iterate until all of the tests pass.

### All tests passed

### A note on testing

Check out the testing files to see how tests are implemented in JavaScript. We will go over the details of implementing tests later in the course.
